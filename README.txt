Deborah’s HTML Project

Overview
This project is a simple website created using pure HTML. It demonstrates the use of semantic tags, tables, media integration (audio and video), and multiple linked pages.  

The purpose is to practice building structured web pages without relying on CSS or JavaScript, while keeping the design clear and functional.
