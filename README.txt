# Deborah’s HTML Project

## Overview
This project is a simple website created using pure HTML. It demonstrates the use of semantic tags, tables, media integration (audio and video), and multiple linked pages.  

The purpose is to practice building structured web pages without relying on CSS or JavaScript, while keeping the design clear and functional.  

## Files
- index.html → Home page with welcome message, about project, and semantics section.  
- about.html → Provides more details about the project and its purpose.  
- media.html → Contains embedded audio and video for demonstration.  
- extras.html → Includes a weekly study timetable organized into a table (Monday–Friday).  
- README.txt → This file (project documentation).  

## How to Run
1. Download all project files (HTML + audio/video assets).  
2. Place them in the same folder.  
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).  
4. Use the navigation links to explore other pages.  

## Notes
- Audio: Background calm beats are included for coding/studying vibes.  
- Video: A YouTube embed has been added to enrich the media section.
